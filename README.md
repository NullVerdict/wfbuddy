# WFBuddy

A crossplatform tool and helper for Warframe.

WFBuddy looks at your game every 3(configurable) seconds, depending on what it sees, it'll display relevant info. PaddleOCR is used for the text recognition.

## Features
- **Cross platform**: Supporting both Windows and Linux.
- **Automatic detection**: No hotkeys required.
- **Relic rewards**: Easy overview of prime values from warframe.market.

## Planned
- **Other languages**: Currently only English interface is supported.
- **Ui Scale**: Currently only a ui scale of 100% is supported.
- **Overlay**: No more looking at an external window.

## Why
- **Why not look at the log file**: The log file is written to buffered. From testing sometimes taking more than 10 seconds to even detect the relic rewards screen is open, making it practically useless.
- **Why make another tool**: I wanted a tool that could run on Linux and had a gui.

## Disclaimer
WFBuddy is in no way associated with the game Warframe or the developer and publisher Digital Extremes.
While WFBuddy only gets screenshots from the game and does not interact with it in any other way, you are using this at your own risk.
